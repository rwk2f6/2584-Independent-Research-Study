Description: Hello! My name is Ryan Kelly, and I am a student at the University of Missouri - Saint Louis.
To complete my required research hours to graduate, I have spent the semester working on an Indepenent Research Study.
My main focus has been to develop an educational game using a language I had not made a game in before. While
looking through some game making tutorials, I found the Games section on CodeGym.com, which provides a helpful package
to create 2D games in Java. Their course on the game 2048 inspired me to make a similar number based puzzle game,
to help introduce students to the Fibonacci sequence. Rights to the game engine and the game class functions
belong to CodeGym.com. A creative commons license has been attached to protect this code from being stolen without
attributing CodeGym or myself. To play the game, follow the link below! To learn more about the game, look
at the attached Programmer's Guide, which includes a User's Manual.
